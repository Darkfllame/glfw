# GLFW for zig 0.12.0

This is a fork of [glfw](https://github.com/hexops/glfw), updated for zig 0.12.0 and packaged with all the dependencies.

Of course this repo will update along [Zig3D](https://github.com/Darkfllame/Zig3D), it will be updated to every major versions of Zig.

If you really want the raw bindings you can use this library. Otherwise, I highly recommend you to use my wrapper library: Zig3D.
